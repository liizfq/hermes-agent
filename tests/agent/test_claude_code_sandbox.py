"""E4 (933c653bd) regression: SANDBOX_PRESETS cron_no_workdir merged into
primary_minus_memory. Verify component uniqueness and preset resolution
changes since the merge.

Design note: SANDBOX_PRESETS values are SandboxComponents dataclasses
(not dicts with a 'digest' key). The manifest digest is computed in
``_collect_manifest_inputs`` + ``_hash_inputs``, where the components
dict is folded in. Therefore, two presets with identical SandboxComponents
would produce identical manifest digests for any fixed hermes_home /
platform / model — which is the exact failure mode E4 fixed
(cron_no_workdir and primary_minus_memory had identical components,
leading to identical digests and a useless preset alias).

These tests guard the invariant: distinct presets must have distinct
SandboxComponents, _resolve_preset must not introduce a separate
cron_no_workdir mapping, and the merged (T, T, T) flag combo must
resolve to primary_minus_memory.
